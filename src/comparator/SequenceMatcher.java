public class SequenceMatcher {
    /**
     * SequenceMatcher is a flexible class for comparing pairs of sequences of
     * any type, so long as the sequence elements are hashable.  The basic
     * algorithm predates, and is a little fancier than, an algorithm
     * published in the late 1980's by Ratcliff and Obershelp under the
     * hyperbolic name "gestalt pattern matching".  The basic idea is to find
     * the longest contiguous matching subsequence that contains no "junk"
     * elements (R-O doesn't address junk).  The same idea is then applied
     * recursively to the pieces of the sequences to the left and to the right
     * of the matching subsequence.  This does not yield minimal edit
     * sequences, but does tend to yield matches that "look right" to people.
     *
     * SequenceMatcher tries to compute a "human-friendly diff" between two
     * sequences.  Unlike e.g. UNIX(tm) diff, the fundamental notion is the
     * longest *contiguous* & junk-free matching subsequence.  That's what
     * catches peoples' eyes.  The Windows(tm) windiff has another interesting
     * notion, pairing up elements that appear uniquely in each sequence.
     * That, and the method here, appear to yield more intuitive difference
     * reports than does diff.  This method appears to be the least vulnerable
     * to synching up on blocks of "junk lines", though (like blank lines in
     * ordinary text files, or maybe "<P>" lines in HTML files).  That may be
     * because this is the only method of the 3 that has a *concept* of
     * "junk" <wink>.
     */

    /**
     * Example, comparing two strings, and considering blanks to be "junk":
     *
     * >>> s = SequenceMatcher(lambda x: x == " ",
     * ...                     "private Thread currentThread;",
     * ...                     "private volatile Thread currentThread;")
     * >>>
     *
     * .ratio() returns a float in [0, 1], measuring the "similarity" of the
     * sequences.  As a rule of thumb, a .ratio() value over 0.6 means the
     * sequences are close matches:
     *
     * >>> print round(s.ratio(), 3)
     * 0.866
     * >>>
     *
     * If you're only interested in where the sequences match,
     * .get_matching_blocks() is handy:
     *
     * >>> for block in s.get_matching_blocks():
     * ...     print "a[%d] and b[%d] match for %d elements" % block
     * a[0] and b[0] match for 8 elements
     * a[8] and b[17] match for 21 elements
     * a[29] and b[38] match for 0 elements
     *
     * Note that the last tuple returned by .get_matching_blocks() is always a
     * dummy, (len(a), len(b), 0), and this is the only case in which the last
     * tuple element (number of elements matched) is 0.
     *
     * If you want to know how to change the first sequence into the second,
     * use .get_opcodes():
     *
     * >>> for opcode in s.get_opcodes():
     * ...     print "%6s a[%d:%d] b[%d:%d]" % opcode
     * equal a[0:8] b[0:8]
     * insert a[8:8] b[8:17]
     * equal a[8:29] b[17:38]
     *
     * See the Differ class for a fancy human-friendly file differencer, which
     * uses SequenceMatcher both to compare sequences of lines, and to compare
     * sequences of characters within similar (near-matching) lines.
     *
     * See also function get_close_matches() in this module, which shows how
     * simple code building on SequenceMatcher can be used to do useful work.
