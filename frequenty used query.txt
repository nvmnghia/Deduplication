1. Select articles with organization properties

SELECT DISTINCT ar.id, ar.title FROM articles ar
    JOIN articles_authors aa ON aa.article_id = ar.id
    JOIN authors_organizes ao ON ao.author_id = aa.author_id
    JOIN organizes o ON o.id = ao.organize_id
    WHERE o.name LIKE '%ton duc thang%'

2. Check merge_logs

SELECT ml.duplication_of FROM merge_logs ml
	WHERE CONCAT(ml.duplication_of, '') NOT IN (
        SELECT isi.raw_scopus_id FROM isi_documents isi
        	WHERE isi.raw_scopus_id != ''
    )

3. Count num of crawled scopus

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM isi_documents.scopus_documents

3. Count num of crawled isi

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM isi_documents.isi_documents

4. Count num of merged scopus

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM articles WHERE is_scopus = 1

5. Count num of merged isi

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM articles WHERE is_isi = 1

6. Count num of duplicated

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM articles WHERE is_scopus = 1 AND is_isi = 1

7. Show isi crawled, merged, and scopus crawled organizations/affiliations

SELECT isi.title, ar.title, scopus.title, isi.affiliation AS isi_crawled_organizes, GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT o.name SEPARATOR '\n') AS merged_organizes, scopus.affiliations AS scopus_crawled_organizes FROM merge_logs ml
	JOIN isi_documents isi ON isi.id = ml.isi_id
    JOIN articles ar ON ar.id = ml.duplication_of
    JOIN articles_authors aa ON aa.article_id = ar.id
    JOIN authors_organizes ao ON ao.author_id = aa.author_id
    JOIN organizes o ON o.id = ao.organize_id
    JOIN scopus_documents scopus ON scopus.id = isi.raw_scopus_id
    GROUP BY ml.isi_id
    HAVING NOT (
        (isi_crawled_organizes LIKE '%ton duc thang%' AND merged_organizes LIKE '%ton duc thang%' AND scopus_crawled_organizes LIKE '%ton duc thang%') OR
        (isi_crawled_organizes NOT LIKE '%ton duc thang%' AND merged_organizes NOT LIKE '%ton duc thang%' AND scopus_crawled_organizes NOT LIKE '%ton duc thang%')
    )

8. Select articles without "ton duc thang" but is merged as "ton duc thang" and vice versa

SELECT DISTINCT ar.id, ar.title, isi.title, GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT o.name SEPARATOR '\n') AS merged_organizations, isi.affiliation FROM articles ar
    JOIN articles_authors aa ON aa.article_id = ar.id
    JOIN authors_organizes ao ON ao.author_id = aa.author_id
    JOIN organizes o ON o.id = ao.organize_id
    JOIN isi_documents isi ON isi.id = ar.raw_isi_id
    GROUP BY ar.id
    HAVING (merged_organizations LIKE '%ton duc thang%' AND isi.affiliation NOT LIKE '%ton duc thang%') OR
    	(merged_organizations NOT LIKE '%ton duc thang%' AND isi.affiliation LIKE '%ton duc thang%')

9. Count representative articles

SELECT rep.id, rep.name, COUNT(DISTINCT ar.id) AS counter FROM representatives rep
    LEFT JOIN organize_representative org_rep ON org_rep.representative_id = rep.id
    LEFT JOIN authors_organizes ao ON org_rep.organize_id = ao.organize_id
    LEFT JOIN articles_authors aa ON aa.author_id = ao.author_id
    LEFT JOIN articles ar ON ar.id = aa.article_id
    WHERE ar.year = 2016 AND ar.is_isi = 1
    GROUP BY rep.id
    ORDER BY counter DESC

10. Show possibly duplicated organizations

SELECT o1.id, o1.name, o1.slug, o2.id, o2.name, o2.slug FROM organizes o1
	JOIN organizes o2 ON o2.slug = SUBSTR(o1.slug, 1, CHAR_LENGTH(o1.slug) - 2)
    WHERE o1.slug LIKE '%-1'
    	OR o1.slug LIKE '%-2'
        OR o1.slug LIKE '%-3'
        OR o1.slug LIKE '%-4'
        OR o1.slug LIKE '%-5'
        OR o1.slug LIKE '%-6'
        OR o1.slug LIKE '%-7'
        OR o1.slug LIKE '%-8'
        OR o1.slug LIKE '%-9'
